# Capstone Project Guidelines – BRICS Astronomy/IDIA Data Analytics

## Objective
The capstone project is an opportunity for participants to apply their data analytics skills to a research or real-world problem, ideally using astronomy-related data but open to other domains. Projects should demonstrate proficiency in data exploration, visualization, modeling (if applicable), and interpretation of results.

---

## Project Requirements

### 1. Project Topic
- Should involve a dataset that allows for meaningful analysis or insights.
- Can be astronomy-focused or from another domain such as climate, health, or economics.
- Participants are encouraged to select a topic of personal or regional relevance within the BRICS context.

### 2. Submission Format
- Submit a single **Google Colab notebook** containing all code, explanations, visualizations, and conclusions.
- Ensure the notebook is well-commented and can be followed by someone with no prior context.
- Share your final notebook as a **view-only link** (no editing permissions).

### 3. Notebook Structure
- **Title & Objective**
- **Dataset Description**
- **Data Cleaning/Preprocessing**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Modeling/Analysis (if applicable)**
- **Results & Interpretation**
- **Conclusion & Future Work**
- **References/Data Sources**

---

## Timeline
- You will have **2–3 weeks** to complete the project.
- Final deadline: Week 8
